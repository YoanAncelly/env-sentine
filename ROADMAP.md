# Gardisto Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and features for the Gardisto project. Items are organized by priority and current status.

## Current Version (v0.3.0)

### âœ… Completed
- **Error Handling Improvements** (December 2024)
  - Implemented robust error handling system with custom error classes
  - Added better error context and stack traces
  - Added error codes for better error identification
  - Implemented proper error recovery mechanisms

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- **Type Safety**
  - Add more TypeScript interfaces and type definitions in `types.ts`
  - Use stricter TypeScript configurations
  - Add proper return type annotations to all functions
  - Consider using branded types for environment variables

### ðŸ“… Planned

#### High Priority

  - Implement secure logging (mask sensitive values)
  - Add environment variable value encryption at rest
  - Implement access control for sensitive environment variables
  - Add security headers and CORS configuration
  - Create security documentation and best practices guide
  - Add automated security vulnerability scanning
  - Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

- **Code Organization**
  - Implement modular architecture by separating concerns
  - Move environment variable checking logic into dedicated class/service
  - Create proper configuration class with secure defaults
  - Implement dependency injection for better testability

- **Testing**
  - Add security-focused test cases
  - Implement penetration testing scenarios
  - Add integration tests for file system scenarios
  - Implement snapshot testing
  - Add performance benchmarks
  - Add property-based testing

#### Medium Priority
- **Documentation**
  - Add JSDoc comments to all public functions and classes
  - Create API documentation using TypeDoc
  - Add more examples in README with security considerations
  - Document common error scenarios and solutions
  - Add contributing guidelines with security requirements
  - Create security policy documentation

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement secure caching for file system operations
  - Add batch processing for large codebases
  - Consider implementing worker threads
  - Add performance monitoring and metrics

- **CI/CD Improvements**
  - Add automated release process with signing
  - Implement semantic versioning
  - Add automated changelog generation
  - Set up automated dependency updates with security checks
  - Add more comprehensive CI checks including security scans

#### Low Priority
- **Developer Experience**
  - Add more CLI options for configurability
  - Implement watch mode for development
  - Add better debug logging options (with security controls)
  - Create VS Code extension

- **Code Quality**
  - Add ESLint with stricter rules and security plugins
  - Implement Prettier for consistent formatting
  - Add SonarQube or similar tool with security rules
  - Add pre-commit hooks for code quality and security checks
